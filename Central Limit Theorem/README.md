# Things to remember when determining the size of your sample
**When figuring out a sample size, here are things to keep in mind:**
Don’t use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.
The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases. 

**Increase the sample size to meet specific needs of your project:**
For a higher confidence level, use a larger sample size
To decrease the margin of error, use a larger sample size
For greater statistical significance, use a larger sample size

**Note:** Sample size calculators use statistical formulas to determine a sample size. More about these are coming up in the course!  Stay tuned.

# Why a minimum sample of 30?
This recommendation is based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the field of probability and statistics. As sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid. Researchers who rely on regression analysis – statistical methods to determine the relationships between controlled and dependent variables – also prefer a minimum sample of 30.


1. The sample distribution is assumed to be normal when the distribution is unknown or not normally distributed according to the central limit theorem. This method assumes that the given population is distributed normally. It helps in data analysis.

2. The sample mean deviation decreases as we increase the samples taken from the population, which helps in estimating the mean of the population more accurately.

3. The sample mean is used to create a range of values which likely includes the population mean.

4. The concept of the central limit theorem is used in election polls to estimate the percentage of people supporting a particular candidate as confidence intervals.

5. CLT is used in calculating the mean family income in a particular country.

6. It is used in rolling many identical, unbiased dice.

7. The probability distribution for the total distance covered in a random walk will approach a normal distribution.

8. Flipping many coins will result in a normal distribution for the total number of heads (or, equivalently total number of tails).

9. By looking at the sample distribution, CLT can tell whether the sample belongs to a particular population.

10. It enables us to make conclusions about the sample and population parameters and assists in constructing good machine-learning models
