1. The sample distribution is assumed to be normal when the distribution is unknown or not normally distributed according to the central limit theorem. This method assumes that the given population is distributed normally. It helps in data analysis.

2. The sample mean deviation decreases as we increase the samples taken from the population, which helps in estimating the mean of the population more accurately.

3. The sample mean is used to create a range of values which likely includes the population mean.

4. The concept of the central limit theorem is used in election polls to estimate the percentage of people supporting a particular candidate as confidence intervals.

5. CLT is used in calculating the mean family income in a particular country.

6. It is used in rolling many identical, unbiased dice.

7. The probability distribution for the total distance covered in a random walk will approach a normal distribution.

8. Flipping many coins will result in a normal distribution for the total number of heads (or, equivalently total number of tails).

9. By looking at the sample distribution, CLT can tell whether the sample belongs to a particular population.

10. It enables us to make conclusions about the sample and population parameters and assists in constructing good machine-learning models
